What is Unit Testing?
It is the execution of a complete class,
routine or small program that has been written by a single programmer or team of programmers,
which is tested in isolation from the more complete system. 
It is to test the smallest units or software components in a program.

Unit testing is conducted by the developer using development tools in their Integrated Development Environment.

It is a type of white box testing, since they can be exposed to the inner workings, i.e codes, of the programme.

What is Integration Testing?
It is the combined execution of two or more classes, packages, components, or subsystems
that have been created by multiple programmers or programming teams.
It is a software testing technique where individual units of a program are combined and tested as a group.
